Last updated: January 31, 2025

### 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, and protection of your personal information by Velox ("we," "us," or "our") when you use our mental math mobile application (the "App"). This policy outlines how we handle your email, profile picture, and photos, as well as your rights regarding the information you provide.

### 2. Information We Collect

1. **Email Address**:

   Providing your email is optional and is only required if you choose to sign up or log in to the App. We use your email for account creation, verification, and optional features like progress syncing across devices.

2. **Profile Picture**:

   You may optionally upload or change your profile picture. Profile pictures are stored securely and only used within the App to personalize your account.

3. **Photos and Camera Access**:

   If you grant permission, we access your deviceâ€™s camera and photo library to allow you to upload a profile picture. This access is solely for this purpose, and we do not store or use your photos outside of this context.

### 3. How We Use Your Information

1. **Email Address**:

   We use your email to enable account creation, provide login functionality, and synchronize your progress across devices. It is not required to use the App unless you opt into these features.

2. **Profile Picture**:

   Your profile picture is used to personalize your account within the App. It is not shared outside the App.

3. **Photos and Camera Access**:

We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties unless we have obtained your explicit consent, are required to do so by law, or when sharing is necessary to provide our services.

### 5. Data Security

We employ reasonable security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. This includes encryption of sensitive data and secure server practices. However, no data transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
